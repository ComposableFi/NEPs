## Summary

A new sdk api `env::block_hash` which will allow contract authors access the blockhashes of 256 of the most reccent blocks. This is akin to the [`blockhash`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties) api in ethereum.


## Motivation

The IBC protocol requires that blockchains (aka host state machines) are able to introspect their own `ConsensusState` (aka Header). This is stated, amongst other requirements in their [IBC host requrements](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/core/ics-024-host-requirements/README.md#consensus-state-introspection). This api is what allows trustless IBC connection handshakes to happen: 

```ts
// ConnOpenTry relays notice of a connection attempt on chain A to chain B (this code is executed on chain B).
function connOpenTry(
  counterpartyConnectionIdentifier: Identifier,
  counterpartyPrefix: CommitmentPrefix,
  counterpartyClientIdentifier: Identifier,
  clientIdentifier: Identifier,
  clientState: ClientState,
  counterpartyVersions: string[],
  delayPeriodTime: uint64,
  delayPeriodBlocks: uint64,
  proofInit: CommitmentProof,
  proofClient: CommitmentProof,
  proofConsensus: CommitmentProof,
  proofHeight: Height,
  consensusHeight: Height) {
    // generate a new identifier
    identifier = generateIdentifier()
    
    abortTransactionUnless(validateSelfClient(clientState))
    abortTransactionUnless(consensusHeight < getCurrentHeight())
    expectedConsensusState = getHostConsensusState(consensusHeight) // we need to return a near header at this height.
    expectedConnectionEnd = ConnectionEnd{INIT, "", getCommitmentPrefix(), counterpartyClientIdentifier,
                             clientIdentifier, counterpartyVersions, delayPeriodTime, delayPeriodBlocks}

    versionsIntersection = intersection(counterpartyVersions, getCompatibleVersions())
    version = pickVersion(versionsIntersection)

    connection = ConnectionEnd{TRYOPEN, counterpartyConnectionIdentifier, counterpartyPrefix,
                               clientIdentifier, counterpartyClientIdentifier, version, delayPeriodTime, delayPeriodBlocks}
    abortTransactionUnless(connection.verifyConnectionState(proofHeight, proofInit, counterpartyConnectionIdentifier, expectedConnectionEnd))
    abortTransactionUnless(connection.verifyClientState(proofHeight, proofClient, clientState))
    abortTransactionUnless(connection.verifyClientConsensusState(
      proofHeight, proofConsensus, counterpartyClientIdentifier, consensusHeight, expectedConsensusState))

    provableStore.set(connectionPath(identifier), connection)
    addConnectionToClient(clientIdentifier, identifier)
}

// ConnOpenAck relays acceptance of a connection open attempt from chain B back to chain A (this code is executed on chain A).
function connOpenAck(
  identifier: Identifier,
  clientState: ClientState,
  version: string,
  counterpartyIdentifier: Identifier,
  proofTry: CommitmentProof,
  proofClient: CommitmentProof,
  proofConsensus: CommitmentProof,
  proofHeight: Height,
  consensusHeight: Height) {
    abortTransactionUnless(consensusHeight < getCurrentHeight())
    abortTransactionUnless(validateSelfClient(clientState))
    connection = provableStore.get(connectionPath(identifier))
    abortTransactionUnless((connection.state === INIT && connection.version.indexOf(version) !== -1)
    expectedConsensusState = getHostConsensusState(consensusHeight) // we need to return a near header at this height.
    expectedConnectionEnd = ConnectionEnd{TRYOPEN, identifier, getCommitmentPrefix(),
                             connection.counterpartyClientIdentifier, connection.clientIdentifier,
                             version, connection.delayPeriodTime, connection.delayPeriodBlocks}
    abortTransactionUnless(connection.verifyConnectionState(proofHeight, proofTry, counterpartyIdentifier, expectedConnectionEnd)) // so we can verify that the counterparty chain has the correct header.
    abortTransactionUnless(connection.verifyClientState(proofHeight, proofClient, clientState))
    abortTransactionUnless(connection.verifyClientConsensusState(
      proofHeight, proofConsensus, connection.counterpartyClientIdentifier, consensusHeight, expectedConsensusState))
    connection.state = OPEN
    connection.version = version
    connection.counterpartyConnectionIdentifier = counterpartyIdentifier
    provableStore.set(connectionPath(identifier), connection)
}
```

The api `env::block_hash` allows us validate the full header submitted via contract calldata by comparing hashes.

## Rationale and alternatives

A few other designs were considered such as a function `env::block_header` which would return the full header at a given height, but was discouraged against a result of expensive db calls. This mapping of block numbers to headers are cheap enough to be stored on-chain.


## Specification

```rust
/// This function should return a blockhash for 256 of the most reccent blocks
fn block_hash(block_height: u64) -> Option<[u8; 32]>;
```

This API will require that the map of block heights to hashes are stored in each shard's state trie pending the implementation of a global state trie.
Based on NEAR's architecture these block hashes will have to be stored in ecah chunk state trie.

Implementation consideration: Extra work to maintain block hashes is required to be done "for free". This has to be efficient.
All 256 block hashes should always stay in memory for that.

### Storage management

Each chunk should keep track of the latest 256 block hashes, mapped to their respective block heights.

There are (at least) two alternatives. One is to store the entire number of hashes in a queue. In this case,
calling the function `block_hash` would imply in the worst case, to iterate over the entire array.
```
key: "latest_block_hashes"
type: Queue<Option<u8; 32>, 256>
```
Alternatively, it would be possible to store a mapping that indicates which blocks are available, and
an array that stores the hashes themselves.

```
key: "mapping_existing_block_hashes"
type: HashMap<block_height, ([u8; 32], IndexInArray)>
```

```
key: "latest_block_hashes"
type: [Option<u8; 32>, 256]
```

where `IndexInArray` tells where this block hash is stored in the `latest_block_hashes` array. This alternative
has the advantage of not needing to iterate over the entire array (or queue) for finding the block hash, but instead
having to maintain two datastructures.

### Missing chunks

If a chunk is skipped, the shard will not contain an updated state trie. That is, the next block will not have access to the latest
256 block hashes. In order to deal with this case, ... TODO
